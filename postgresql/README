In previous years, I've attempted to solve Advent of Code puzzles using PostgreSQL.
Although currently I'm using Rust for Advent of Code, I wanted to preserve these SQL solutions.

To execute a solution, use the `./run` script.
Usage: `./run <year> <puzzle>`
Example: `./run 2021 13b`

The runner script expects `psql` to be able to connect to PostgreSQL using the default connection parameters.
The solutions will create an "aoc" schema, and will either rollback or abort when done.
